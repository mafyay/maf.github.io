Hi!

My name is Mafalda (she/her), and I'm a 23 year-old student from Lisbon, Portugal.

I finished my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering in 2021, and am now pursuing my Master's degree in the same area. During the summer of 2023, I had the dearest opportunity of doing an internship at [Aptoide](https://en.aptoide.com/), where I got to work in Android development with a genuinely wonderful team of people.

Throughout my academic life, and especially during this internship, I got to understand what really interests and moves me: being able to find solutions for everyday troubles, as well as building interesting, well-designed, and reliable products, alongside smart, kind and admirable teammates.

I've set this website up with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the incredible [Chirpy theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) with two objectives in mind: write blog posts, and showcase personal projects. My main intention with the blog posts is to establish some sort of personal documentation. While working on academic, professional and personal projects, I've come across various problems and bugs, and I'd like to have some place where I can compile the solutions I've developed for them. I've then decided to also publish these posts online, in the hopes of them being useful to anyone that may need them and find them.

Outside of school and work, I really enjoy spending time with the people I love the most, practicing sports, reading and collecting books, and learning languages!

If you'd like to know more about my education, personal projects and work ambitions, or just want talk about anything in general, please don't hesitate to contact me at <a href="javascript:location.href = 'mailto:' + ['mafaldacravo','gmail.com'].join('@')">mafaldacravo@gmail.com</a>.

Bye!

Before I go, here's something that's been on my mind...
